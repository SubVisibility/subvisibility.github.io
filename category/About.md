### What are subvisible particles?

Protein-based therapeutics have become critical in modern medicine for combating various diseases with over 400 individual biopharmaceutical products hold active licenses from U.S. Food and Drug Administration (`FDA`), the European Medicines Agency (`EMA`), and Republic of Korea's Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (`MFDS`), contributing to a notable market valued at greater than 300 billion USD. With the number of drugs approved for clinical use increasing dramatically over the past decade, the impact of protein-based treatments in sustaining modern healthcare is becoming more evident.

However, large biomolecules have delicate structures, making them prone to unfolding and aggregation. This process is often promoted by stressors such as heat or mechanical stress encountered during different stages of the product life cycle. The emerging particles  exhibit different sizes, ranging from the nanometer to the visible size range, and can cause undesired efficacy loss and immune responses. Furthermore, any particle of size bigger than 10 &#181; m has potential to block (`embolize`) small blood vessels, including veins and capillaries. As such, for pharmaceutical companies, it is crucial to implement thorough monitoring and control strategies to ensure the safety and efficacy of these therapeutics throughout their development, manufacturing, and storage processes.

As described above, in the context of therapeutic products derived from biological sources, such as proteins, monoclonal antibodies, and vaccines, SvPs are of significant concern. As a result, regulatory agencies such as the U.S. FDA and EMA have set strict guidelines for the detection, characterization, and control of SvPs in biopharmaceuticals. In particular, the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) `Chapter <788>` and `Chapter <1787>` are the primary regulatory standard for SvPs in injectable drugs, setting limits on the acceptable number of SvPs in parenteral (injectable) drugs.

> `USP <788>` requires that particles larger than 10 &#181; m remain below a concentration of 6,000 particles per container.

Quality assessment of protein-based therapeutics has reached a pivotal point with breakthroughs in imaging techniques. In particular, the development of Flow Imaging Microscopy (`FIM`) has enabled the highly sensitive detection of subvisible particles (SvP - particles of size 2 to 100 &#181; m), facilitating the assessment of particle count and size distribution, even for certain translucent protein particles. Here is what SvPs look like under FIM.

With this initiative, our goal is to leverage advanced artificial intelligence techniques, including deep learning and computer vision, to analyze and characterize SvPs in injectable biopharmaceuticals.
